# PetCare

## Project Vision
Pets are becoming an important family member since they relieve the pressure of work and life, provide companionship, and increase the fun of life. Therefore, the care and medical facilities for pets are also receiving increasing attention from pet owners. Even though there is a multitude of vet clinics and stores in the current market, it is still a problem for pet owners to get quality pet services efficiently.
Pet Care is designed to provide a convenient and high-efficient platform for both pet owners and vet clinics, where users can easily get service providerâ€™s detailed information including contact and reputation even book a pet service appointment and create a scheduled order.
